MedPath is a community of graduate pre-medical students committed to empowering students from underserved backgrounds who are interested in healthcare careers. By sharing the insight gained from our individual pre-medical paths, we provide mentorship, support, and access to opportunities that help students navigate their journey and realize their aspirations.

MedPath began with a simple realization: the journey to medicine is rarely straightforward, especially for students without access to mentorship or insider guidance. As graduate pre-medical students who once navigated this process ourselves, we saw firsthand how confusing, isolating, and overwhelming the path can be.

What started as informal conversations and shared advice grew into a community built on transparency, support, and representation. MedPath exists to close the information gap by sharing real experiences, practical guidance, and opportunities that help students confidently move forward on their path to healthcare.
