MedPath is a community of graduate pre-medical students committed to empowering students from underserved backgrounds who are interested in healthcare careers. By sharing the insight gained from our individual pre-medical paths, we provide mentorship, support, and access to opportunities that help students navigate their journey and realize their aspirations.
