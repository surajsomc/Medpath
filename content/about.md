# About Us

Med Path at UCSD is a group of over 300 medical students who are eager to share advice and resources with premed students at UCSD and beyond.

We partner with the UCSD Career Center, the School of Medicine Office of Admissions, and the Office of Outreach & Pathway Programs to host student panels, provide 1-on-1 advising, and distribute free resources to all premed students at UCSD and beyond.

We are part of the Med Path network, which is expanding to serve premeds at different college campuses around the world.
