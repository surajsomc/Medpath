Our post-bacc pre-med student mentors are here to support you as you explore healthcare careers and plan your next steps.

## How It Works

Meet our mentors—current UCSD post-bacc students who have been through the pre-med path. They can share guidance on courses, applications, and life as a pre-med student. More structured programs like 1-on-1 advising and essay review are coming soon.
